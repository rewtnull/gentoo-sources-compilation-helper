NAME

	gch - gentoo-sources compilation helper

VERSION

	0.20

SYNOPSIS:

	gch.sh	[--help|-h] [--version|-v] [--kernel|-k <version>]
		[--initramfs|-i] [--yestoall|-y]

DESCRIPTION

	If you're tired of manually (re)compiling your gentoo-sources for the
	N:th time, or you're just lazy, this is the script for you.

	If a new gentoo-sources update has been synced, or you want to recompile
	your kernel for what ever reason, all you need to do is to run this
	script without arguments, or explicitly choose kernel version to install
	by using the --kernel option. No need to run eselect or symlinking kernel
	manually.

	What this script does:

	- Leads you through kernel configuration and compilation by boolean (y/n)
	  questions (or optionally answers these for you because your time is too
	  valuable to answer questions)
	- Checks if your /boot directory is empty, and if it is, asks to mount it
	- Automatically re-links your current (or explicit) kernel version to
	  /usr/src/linux
	- Checks if a .config file exists, if not, you will either get an option
	  to deflate it from /proc/config.gz, or manually setup new kernel .config
	- Compiles kernel and (optionally) modules, depending on your makearg
	  settings
	- Optionally generates initramfs to /boot with the --initramfs option
	- Adds kernel to grub by running grub-mkconfig
	- Automatically unmounts /boot, if mounted, after installation
	- Makes a copy of /usr/src/linux/.config to /boot/config-<version>
	- Adds *-x64* to naming because i don't know

ARGUMENTS

	-h, --help			Display this help
	-v, --version			Display version and exit

	OPTIONS

	-k, --kernel <kernel>		Kernel version in format:
					linux-<version>-gentoo[<-r<1-9>>]
	-i, --initramfs			Generate initramfs
	-y, --yestoall			Automatically answer yes to all questions

	No arguments, --kernel option, optionally --yestoall and/or --initramfs
	option accepted

DEPENDENCIES

	You need to be root to run this script

	- Bash v4.4 or newer		app-shells/bash
	- gentoo-sources		sys-kernel/gentoo-sources
	- getopt			sys-apps/util-linux
	- perl				dev-lang/perl
	- grub				sys-boot/grub
	- find				sys-apps/findutils
	- uname				sys-apps/coreutils
	- zcat				app-arch/gzip

	Only needed for initramfs support:

	- dracut			sys-kernel/dracut

	The following kernel flags are used for /proc/config.gz support,
	and need to be set:

	- CONFIG_PROC_FS
	- CONFIG_IKCONFIG
	- CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC

	gch.sh has built in sanity checks and will exit if any of these
	conditions are not met.

CONFIGURATION

	gch.conf is to be kept in the same directory as gch.sh


	bootmount

	    Default location to install kernel binaries

	Default: "/boot"



	grubcfg

	    Grub configuration file in relation to the bootmount setting

	Default: "${bootmount}/grub/grub.cfg"



	fstab

	    fstab location

	Default: "/etc/fstab"



	kernelroot

	    Kernel source root location

	Default: "/usr/src"



	makeconf

	    make kernel configuration option This could be "oldconfig",
	    "xconfig", "menuconfig" and so on.
	    See https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Kernel/Configuration
	    for more information.

	Default: "oldconfig"



	makearg

	    make kernel build options. See
	    https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Kernel/Configuration for
	    more information.

	Default: "bzImage modules modules_install install"



	makeopt

	    Override /etc/portage/make.conf MAKEOPTS options. See MAKE(1)
	    and MAKE.CONF(5) for more information

	Default: ""



	architecture

	    Adds architecture to name. i.e. vmlinuz-<version>-x64-gentoo ...
	    Valid options are "x32" and "x64"

	Default: "x64"



	dracutopt

	    dracut options. If you don't use initramfs, you can safely ignore
	    this. Do NOT add --force and/or --kver options, since these are
	    already hardcoded. See DRACUT(8) for more information on which
	    options you can use. Renaming with the architecture setting is not
	    supported, as dracut searches /lib/modules/<kernel version> for
	    modules to be included in the initramfs

	Default: ""



	dracut

	    Optional. Set this to "1" if you want to generate initramfs when
	    running the script without arguments

	Default: ""

				[*] Removed unnecessary duplicate code
				[*] Minor code cleanup
	v0.7 (20170715)		[*] Moved variable to a more logical place
				[-] Removed variable pointer and left over
				    eval from an earlier idea

				    Kernel version sanity handler should now
				    be fixed for realsies

				    either moving or copying kernel to
				    boot directory

				    same with less code, also removed superflous
				    check
